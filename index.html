    <h1>Amanda Fuentes</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page! I guess I will talk a little bit about myself since it is a page about me...I am a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and minoring in sports administration at the University of Miami. I am a local from Miami and enjoy dancing, the ocean, and Asian food. To keep myself busy and involved on campus, I am apart of the following organizations and clubs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>UMTV's SportsDesk</li>
        <li>Category 5 Spirit Programming Board</li>
        <li>Alpha Delta Pi Sorority</li>
      </ul>
